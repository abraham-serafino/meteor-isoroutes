# meteor-isoroutes

Simple and clean, express-like, isomorphic routes for Meteor.JS

## Examples

The front-end uses browser-express and the backend uses Meteor's built-in connect handlers (from express).

To see how the routes are "wired up," have a look at `imports/client.js` and `imports/server.js`

To see how the routes are included in the app, see `imports/App/App.routes.js`

Each page has its own route - see the `~Page` component at the end of `App/Character/Character.page.js` and `App/Counter/Counter.page.js`
